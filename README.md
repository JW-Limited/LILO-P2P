## How it works

- Download the latest build and Open `p2p.exe` as admin on the device you want to send data and on the one you want to recieve it.

- Copy the `My Lan or Wan IP` and communicate it to other peer and vice versa.
- The 2 peers have now the 2 endpoint to connect to, so press on both `Connect`.
- The 2 peers now are able to `sent messages` `transfer data` or take the `Remote Desktop Control` between them.

It's use [UDT protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP-based_Data_Transfer_Protocol)
and thanks to `rendezvous` connection, it should be able to `bypass most firewall rules`.
